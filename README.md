Code written for the Minor research course during my Masters Degree with snippets of results produced provided. 

This includes experiments on 

- Reliability Analysis with the Doubly Stochastic Deep Gaussian Process and (Bootstrap and Bayesian) Support Vector Regression models. 
- Multifidelity (Deep) Gaussian Process surrogate modeling
- An ongoing (updated) C++ implementation of Chu Wei's Bayesian Support Vector Machine.
