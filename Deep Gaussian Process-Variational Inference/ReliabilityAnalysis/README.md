Application of Doubly Stochastic DGP with Reliability Analysis, where the aim is to accurate capture the Limit-state function (LSF) and its probability of failure.

Demo shows results on the four-branch function. More study is required to understand its approximate Gaussian posterior with the acquisition functions.
